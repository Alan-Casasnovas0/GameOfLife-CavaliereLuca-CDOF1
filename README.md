# GameOfLife-CavaliereLuca-CDOF1

Implementation of Game of Life from scratch
The **Game of Life**, created by John Conway, is a zero-player game played on a 2D grid of cells. Each cell can be either **alive** or **dead**, and the game evolves over discrete steps according to these rules:

1. **Survival**: A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive.
2. **Death by Underpopulation**: A living cell with fewer than 2 living neighbors dies.
3. **Death by Overpopulation**: A living cell with more than 3 living neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction**: A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive.

Each step updates all cells simultaneously based on the current state of the grid. The game's dynamics emerge from the initial configuration of cells.
For more in depth explanations, you can look at the wiki page of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
